I wrote this doc up to tell the story of what this project is all about There's a high level overview + some extreme detail for anyone who is a geek about the tech https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ryuTboVSIoi5Oa7FmJbndY7D2FUrYf3T\_-KJbuQFwCU/edit

@loothero#8724@el\_ranye#4179@timshel#2540@iain#0089 TLDR = > **Chainspace is an experimental, conceptual art project** > > ‚Ä¢ Built by <@296138944033325057> and <@812704860553478154> with heroic support from <@829205052006203402> on contract design and <@92407472559521792> on BTC node-wrangling. > > ‚Ä¢ No promises, no roadmap, no guarantees ‚Äî and please read the google doc for more disclaimers and potential challenges!

**What is the NFT?** > ‚Ä¢ Each NFT is a "portal" to Chainspace > > ‚Ä¢ In Chainspace, you are the art > > ‚Ä¢ You're free to take screenshots/gifs/share/inscribe/anything you want with your "memories" from Chainspace) > > ‚Ä¢ Each portal is a fully on-chain art machine that emits infinite art **Do I need a BTC wallet?** > No, just an ETH wallet is all you need.

@iain#0089 **\*Where does it live?**\* ‚îî‚îÅ‚îÅ‚´∏ On both ETH and BTC, as one NFT, bound together as one through the magic of chainspace (and by <@829205052006203402> contract design lol) > ‚Ä¢ The NFT is a high-functionality digital artifact that lives fully onchain on BTC > > ‚Ä¢ But...is mintable and tradeable on ETH! > > ‚Ä¢ Not as a ‚Äúcopy‚Äù of it‚Ä¶but actually the ETH NFT renders the corresponding BTC NFT essentially directly from the BTC Inscription ID by using Ordinals.com‚Äôs endpoint. \
**Can I get the BTC Inscription directly?** ‚îî‚îÅ‚îÅ‚´∏ Yes > Each ETH NFT is tethered and bound to its BTC counterpart, and the plan is for you to be able to take custody of it with your BTC wallet when you're ready, or you can just keep it on ETH. \
**DO I NEED A BITCOIN WALLET?** = NO > To participate in this project, you do NOT need a BTC wallet on day one > > We'll be minting as a 721 on ETH via Zora, and then the intention is to provide a process whereby you can burn or turn in your ETH NFT to take custody of your BTC Digital Artifact aka Inscription (aka NFT). > > The magic here is that the NFT on ETH has a tokenURI that points directly to Ordinals.com's endpoint that reads from Bitcoin. For the metadata and the core "app"/art, there's no need for IPFS, Arweave, AWS, or servers, other than to render it from Ordinals.com‚Äôs endpoint on top of their BTC node, which can be recreated by anyone by just reading the BTC block history. \
**TL;DR:** > ‚Ä¢ Inscribed on BTC > ‚Ä¢ Tradeable/ownable on ETH > ‚Ä¢ Bound together as one > + The intention is to create a process by which you trade in or burn the ETH NFT to take custody of the corresponding BTC Inscription to your direct BTC wallet

**Is it 100% onchain?** > No...but: > > ‚õì It's 200% **onchains** ‚õìÔ∏è > > At the core, no Arweave, no IPFS, no AWS > > The core "app" (the portal) is inscribed as a 100% onchain NFT on BTC > > And the tradeable NFT is minted as a 100% onchain NFT on ETH > > Bound together through chainspace (aka through the TokenURI on ETH, check it out)

**Wen mint?** >

**What is the supply?** ‚îî‚îÅ‚îÅ‚´∏ 800 ~~600~~ > There are 800+ portals to Chainspace inscribed on BTC already. We‚Äôll have 800 in the collection. > > Including 20 of the **Model 0xbc1ùïè** portals that will be staying only on BTC and maybe auctioned after the normal ETH mint. Some will be donated to Mathcastles too. > > The earliest alpha portal was InscriptionID 10,004. Will create a json with the full set. It spans like 15k through 85k

@loothero#8724@el\_ranye#4179@iain#0089 **What is the mint plan?** ‚Ä¢ Minting on ETH via an amazing custom Zora contract that <@829205052006203402> wrote. ‚Ä¢ Will mint here: ‚îî‚îÅ‚îÅ‚´∏ > \
\
**Allowlist**: **620 to mint,** for the Allowlist only (more details shortly of where to drop your address) > = <@&1073334051596947606> and <@&1073333321309896774> > > \
**Airdrop**: **100 dropped** to the legends who helped get us here + devs/builders/people who I want to thank for supporting me on my personal journey > > \
**Team**: 60 for the team (me, <@296138944033325057> + <@829205052006203402> + <@92407472559521792> as a thank you for heroism) > > \
**Auction**: 20 of the special ùïè-Portals have been quietly inscribed on BTC and we are planning to auction some of them as a BTC-only NFTs in the coming weeks

@0x113d#0113@xaltgeist#6492 **Chainspace is a love letter to Mathcastles / Terraforms** <@806008599461232651> and <@869769124342009917> opened our eyes to the power and possibilities of Chainspace. Not only has Mathcastles brought together a community of people who live in the future together, the team has also gifted our ecosystem with an incredible font, character sets and color palettes that manifest visions, dreams, and alternative realities. Fun fact: with 113‚Äôs blessing, we have inscribed the Mathcastles font fully on-chain inside every single portal. And as you‚Äôll see in the traits, 90% of the character sets and color palettes are built with the Mathcastles‚Äô magic. Explore them here in more detail. ‚îî‚îÅ‚îÅ‚´∏https://www.terraformexplorer.xyz/ This is not a ‚ÄúMathcastles‚Äù project, but inside the hypercastle, we manifested the dream of chainspace. ‚îî‚îÅ‚îÅ‚´∏https://discord.gg/mathcastles

**Is this art? Where's the art?** In Chainspace, > you > are > the > art

Unique and beautiful

E-bumTue Feb 14 2023 10:34:38 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 I saw this. So it's actually possible to be assigned to inscription #10004 (the test?). Or is the lowest number possible 15,892 (first production model)?

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 10:38:35 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

naw - i'm keeping 10,004 and will prob even burn it ‚Äî and it's already minted here: https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xf8c1ef90a68574e2da390c24bb2599b0f9b2e37b/1

E-bumTue Feb 14 2023 10:56:45 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 Good choice. So 15,892-approx. current is the range then yea

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 10:56:58 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

yep with bursts of inscriptions

E-bumTue Feb 14 2023 10:57:53 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 sorry, what do you mean bursts?

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 10:58:01 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@E-bum#9443 like batches

E-bumTue Feb 14 2023 10:58:15 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 ah right, meaning you did them in clusters

err... inscribed in clusters

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 11:01:24 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

ya

t\_clowTue Feb 14 2023 11:09:00 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

This is one of those collections where inscription number doesn‚Äôt even matter

Bobby PeruTue Feb 14 2023 11:09:15 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 <@812704860553478154> any chance to stagger the mint? 4am in Asia and overallocated..we are not gonna make it üò¶

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 11:13:53 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@Bobby Peru#2990 bah, sorry, i don't think i can change now that i've communicated really sorry about that

MattiTue Feb 14 2023 11:25:30 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

I am the art

Bobby PeruTue Feb 14 2023 11:26:38 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 <:sadge:836444104849096714>

I'll set a couple of alarms then!

Will you announce the winner of the airdrop from the ones that participated on your recent tweet before the mint?

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 11:29:01 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

will try to do today ‚Äî to be clear this one will be outside the "official" collection, like the other custom portals, but it will be sent to the winner's BTC address. purely fun

Bobby PeruTue Feb 14 2023 11:35:49 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)

@timshel#2540 sounds rad!

timshelTue Feb 14 2023 11:38:17 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)
