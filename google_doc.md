You use any ETH or ethereum wallet to mint.&#x20;

### What is Chainspace?

Chainspace is an [experimental art project ](https://twitter.com/TimshelXYZ/status/1623772547149090844)built by [Elranye](https://twitter.com/el\_\_ranye) and [Timshel](https://twitter.com/timshelXYZ/) with heroic support from [Iain](https://twitter.com/isiain) on contract design and [LootHero](https://twitter.com/aloothero) on BTC node-wrangling. &#x20;

\


Inspired by 113d and Dom — thank you both opening my ideas to the power and possibilities of on-chain art computers + the encouragement and energy along the way.

#### Chainspace is art

Each portal is a generative, high functionality digital object that emits infinite art.  People have created truly amazing art in the Discord across all of the channels.  And beyond, people have already begun inscribing their “Memories from Chainspace” as their own art on BTC directly using [OrdinalsBot](https://ordinalsbot.com/) or [Gamma](https://gamma.io/ordinals) or their own [nodes…](https://ordinals.com/)&#x20;

\

\


Wow, I’m speechless.

\


In chainspace, you are the art.

#### Chainspace is a love letter to Mathcastles / Terraforms

113 and Xalt opened our eyes to the power and possibilities of Chainspace. Not only has Mathcastles brought together a community of people who live in the future together, the team has also gifted our ecosystem with an incredible font, character sets and color palettes that manifest visions, dreams, and alternative realities.

\


Fun fact: With 113’s blessing, we have inscribed the Mathcastles font fully on-chain inside every single portal.  And as you’ll see in the traits, 90% of the character sets and color palettes are built with the Mathcastles’ magic.  [Explore them here](https://www.terraformexplorer.xyz/) in more detail.

\


This is not a “Mathcastles” project, but inside the hypercastle, we manifested the dream of chainspace. &#x20;

\


Join Mathcastles here —> [https://discord.gg/mathcastles](https://discord.gg/mathcastles) <—— Mathcastles is the most magical thing in NFTland. &#x20;

\


#### Chainspace is a utility

Chainspace is a “200% on chains”, web3-native a way to show our humanity, our faces, and our essence…without doxxing.

\


#### Chainspace is a place to learn together

My goal with this project is to create a safe space for learning at the edge of the universe, filled with our essential humanity.  The Discord is a little chaotic right now, but over time this will distill down into a calm place for art and learning.  A place designed for patience, kindness, and reflection.&#x20;

\


#### Chainspace is performance art

Each wave, each snapshot, and each ensuing inscription is a singular performance and a meta-performance, where you are the performer, and we’re your audience.

\


#### Chainspace is conceptual art

If the portal itself is inscribed onchain, that means it’s accessible to anyone, for as long as BTC continues to exist.  No keys, no passwords, no servers.  So if anyone can access the portal, and anyone can make art using it…why would anyone want to “own” the portal at all? 🙂

#### Chainspace is a new kind of NFT — ”200% on chains” 😝

The portal is a fully-contained HTML file with no external dependencies. It has been “inscribed” (minted/stored/saved) onto the Bitcoin blockchain as an “[Ordinal Inscription](https://ordinals.com/)” making it 100% onchain. &#x20;

\


This means that it will effectively live forever, or as long as Bitcoin exists, with no reliance on AWS, Arweave, IPFS or any software.  Anyone with a node can spin up an endpoint that&#x20;

renders these Portals directly from Bitcoin.

\


But there’s more — this same NFT [also lives on Ethereum](https://opensea.io/collection/chainspace-app), also 100% onchain (all metadata is on-chain on ETH, and all art for ETH renders from the onchain BTC NFT).&#x20;

\


Through a creative solution designed by me and [Iain from Zora](https://twitter.com/isiain) (who wrote all of the code!), the ETH NFT’s TokenURI equals its corresponding Bitcoin NFT.  Meaning the art for the NFT on ETH comes from Bitcoin directly. No art on ETH chain, or AWS, or IPFS or Arweave.  Just pure BTC<>ETH.  🤯

\


For holders of the ETH NFT, they can take custody of the direct BTC NFT by “untethering” the two portals and burning the ETH NFT and providing a supported BTC wallet address.

\


This is extremely geeky, but I think it’s freaking magical.

\


The Plan

\


There are 600 portals inscribed on BTC and [soon to launch on ETH](https://chainspace.app/mint), including 20 special 𝕏-Portals hidden in the mix, will be kept only on BTC and auctioned later.

\


Timing = Weds timing TBD

\


Mint fee = 0.33ETH (not 0.33BTC)

\


Airdrop — 100 — dropped to the extended network of people who helped me bring this to life, coached me along my Web3 journey, and who have given me confidence and energy along the way

\


Allowlist Mint — 420 — open to people in Discord who are the art.  Mint price TBD. &#x20;

It will be overallocated, so no guarantees, but we’ll try not too go too crazy.  We’re doing this because we want try to avoid a gas war and botters.

\


Team — 60 — for the team (me, elranye + iain and loothero as a thank you for your heroism)

\


Special X-Portals — 20 — for the Terraforms community + an auction for some of them

## Projects have made custom Chainspace portals that unify their communities in Chainspace. &#x20;

For examples go to [Chainspace.app](http://chainspace.app/)

\


## Here’s how to make a custom Chainspace portal TUNED to \[COMMUNITY/PROJECT]

To be clear, these custom portals are outside of the core collection. &#x20;

To access the core collection, go to:

\


This should take like 5 min if you go simple, but feel free to go nuts. &#x20;

\


### All you’re doing is changing 8 colors + picking a set of a handful of characters, then saving and sending to Timshel.  No need to be a dev.

\


1. Download these two files
2.
   1. HTML page —  DM me
   2. JSON character sets and colors — DM me
   3. Actually since this doc is extremely public now, please DM @TimshelXYZ on Twitter or Discord, or tag any mod in Discord for this&#x20;

\


2. Open with Textmate or whatever

\


3. Change line 18 — the page title
4.
   1. Standard is Chainspace.app — \[Project Name]
   2. But go nuts if you want
   3. Add your own name in between lines 7 and 8 if you want credit :)&#x20;

\


4. Don’t touch code between lines 24-25 — that’s the entire Mathcastles font in base64 🙂.  Don’t change line 47 either.

\


5. Main Step = Change the color set and character set in lines 171 and 172
6.
   1. As many characters as you want, within reason
   2. As many colors as you want, within reason (hex colour picker [here](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors\_picker.asp))

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L8Bm7IbppMWtVniM-Ur9ZtjVJQGCSPeJWYah6ESC1sNrU\_W04Yi6qCI3hEtGkOgvt3KD1mI8l4dNjGypSf9mmtIj2\_7Kjaru-K31m0awooH8WgNx5NIlozbTCFuJy6zfjSRG1q1bdFzqqHgnT76Vu6w)

\


6. Save the file and drag it into your browser. Each time you tweak, save and refresh browser.

\


7. You can choose any colors but the character set should be chosen from the standard keyboard ABCDE, etc, or from the json file you downloaded in step 1.

\


8. When done, save and send just the HTML to Timshel

\


9. Done!

\


### For advanced devs, feel free to go as nuts as you want with this file, but please test it.

And please don’t funk with the MC font section in 24-25

\


If you make an innovation in this file that advances the capabilities of Chainspace, please document it inline and then discuss with Timshel so we can add it to a new Model of the Chainspace Portal.

\


Release notes:

\


* Model 0 = alpha test. Inscription 10,004 if curious.
* Model 0xbc1 = first production model.  Desktop only.  [15,892](https://ordinals.com/inscription/460233fe342bdd31db6bde9c4241cb18cdc8342f949d6dd865b8716a6e0cfeeei0) was first one.
* Model 0xbc1.2 = second production model, now with Mobile support.
* 𝕏-Model (0xbc1𝕏) = surprise
* Model 0xbc1.2 = ????? maybe never, but also we’d love help innovating here

COMMENT SECTION

WOULD LOVE TO HEAR EVERYONE’S THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND FEEDBACK

If you want edit access to this sheet, just request it, I trust you all.

\


Comment 1: what is the light green role on the discord for?

* It’s the role that commemorates the fact that you had a feeling, then begun to understanding, then it clicked — you realized that in this project, unlike most, it turns out that You Are the Art

\


reminds me of wen i first used photo booth, good feeling

* Photobooth -> snapchat filters -> chainspace

\
\


Looks good and fair to me. Some light copy editing if you move this to a medium article or something similar. Otherwise, perfect!
