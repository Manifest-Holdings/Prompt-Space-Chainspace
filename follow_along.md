\*\*\_\_UPDATE\_\_\*\*:&#x20;

\


the signups to premint have been immediately overwhelming, omg — we're going to up the supply to 800 to make room for more people. no increase to mint fee.

\


\+ please: no need to DM me asking to prebuy it at a higher price off the market before the mint. i'm honored, but you know i can't do that!

\


though maybe at 0.33 \*\*\_\_BTC\_\_\*\*  we could do some presales lol <:kek:1061832257884663898> (kidding kidding)

\


——————————————————————————————————————————————

all right, Chainspace mint details, here we go:

\


• \*\*\_\_Launches\_\_\*\*: \<t:1676491200:f>

\


• \*\*\_\_Where\_\_\*\*: on ETH! via a custom Zora contract designed by <@829205052006203402>

└━━⫸<[https://chainspace.app/mint](https://chainspace.app/mint)>

\


• \*\*\_\_Wait I thought this was BTC?\_\_\*\*:&#x20;

\> It IS!  The portals are fully inscribed on BTC as NFTs, and then the ETH contract renders them via the TokenURI, straight from [Ordinals.com](http://ordinals.com)'s endpoint to BTC.

\


• \*\*\_\_How can I get the BTC side of the NFT?\_\_\*\*

\> Once the tech is ready (seemingly not so far away), and if you want you'll be able to burn or trade it your ETH NFT to take custody of your BTC NFT (aka Inscription), or can just keep and trade/vault/etc with your ETH NFT.

\


• \*\*\_\_Mint fee\_\_\*\*:&#x20;

\> 0.33 (eth not btc lol)

\


• \*\*\_\_Supply\_\_\*\*: 600

\


• \*\*\_\_Allocation\_\_\*\*:

\> \*\*Airdrop\*\* — 100 — dropped to the extended network of people who helped me bring this to life, coached me along my Web3 journey, and who have given me confidence and energy along the way

\>&#x20;

\> \*\*Allowlist Mint\*\* — 420 — see below for AL criteria

\>&#x20;

\> It will be overallocated, so no guarantees, but we’ll try not too go too crazy.  We’re doing this because we want try to avoid a gas war and botters.

\>&#x20;

\> \*\*Team\*\* — 60 — for the team (me, elranye + iain and loothero as a thank you for your heroism and care)

\>&#x20;

\> \*\*Special X-Portals\*\* — 20 — some for the Terraforms community + an auction for the others.&#x20;

@everyone the first portal to chainspace has been quietly open on the BTC side since Inscription 10,004

\


now, the portal is revealing it slowly on the other side — on Ethereum.&#x20;

\


is each portal is a reflection of its counterpart? is it a copy? is it a clone?&#x20;

\


this is conceptual, experiment art — no promises and no roadmap. it is what it is.&#x20;
