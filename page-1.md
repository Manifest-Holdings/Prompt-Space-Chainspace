    @everyone the first portal to chainspace has been quietly open on the BTC side since Inscription 10,004 now, the portal is revealing it slowly on the other side — on Ethereum. is each portal is a reflection of its counterpart? is it a copy? is it a clone? this is conceptual, experiment art — no promises and no roadmap. it is what it is. Ξ—⌬—₿ —> \_check the tokenURI\_ minting soon. nothing to do yet, just be art. <#1073176261574279208> <#1073333717860360302> <#1073333752278814790>

    @0x113d#0113 i'm going to say this over and over again, but i can't thank <@806008599461232651> and Terraforms enough for opening our eyes to the possibilities of chainspace and for the incredible character sets, palettes and now on-chain magical Terraforms unicode font

    please help give some love to this — i don't have many followers! it would be nice to introduce the power of Chainspace to more people who can use it to bring their essence and humanity to places usually reserved for text, emojis and tiny static profile pictures
